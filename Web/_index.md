subtitle : evulkan; a Vulkan Graphics Library # Put your thesis title here
summary:  Vulkan is a low-level graphics and compute API which aims to provide users with faster
    draw speeds by removing overhead from the driver. The user is expected to
    explicitly provide the details previously generated by the driver. The
    resulting extra code can be difficult to understand and taxing to write
    for beginners, leading to the need for a helper library.
