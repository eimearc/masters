Bournemouth University MSc Computer Animation and Visual Effects 2019/2020 master's project.

Vulkan is a low-level graphics and compute API which aims to provide users with faster draw speeds
by removing overhead from the driver. The user is expected to explicitly provide the details previously
generated by the driver. The resulting extra code can be difficult to understand and taxing to write
for beginners, leading to the need for a helper library - evulkan.

evulkan is for newcomers to Vulkan and helps with setting up some of the more esoteric components 
of Vulkan including the swapchain, synchronization objects and the command buffers. It is suited to
multithreaded programming.
